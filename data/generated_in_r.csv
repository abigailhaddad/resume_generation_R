Projects

R Shiny Dashboard for Supply Chain Performance Metrics
In this project, I developed an interactive R Shiny dashboard that tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) in the supply chain, including inventory levels, on-time delivery rates, order fill rates, and more. I utilized R packages such as ggplot2, leaflet, and plotly for visualization, and dplyr and tidyr for data wrangling.

GIS Analysis of Store Locations and Sales Performance
I created an R script that combines store location data with sales data to provide insights into the effects of location on sales performance. I utilized the leaflet package to display store locations on an interactive map and ggplot2 to visualize sales performance by region. The project informed the company's expansion strategy and helped to identify underperforming locations for potential relocation or closure.
